# Dog vs Cat Classification

This is the instruction for my implementation. You can run my code through 2 options: Kaggle or Colab.

My model "dogvscat.h5" is shared on Google Drive: 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hNVqzvvxysg7o8NZK3wqv8UsFd5VtUAF/view?usp=sharing'

## Option 1: Kaggle
- Access to my Kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/npk7264/dog-vs-cat-classification.
- This notebook contains all the steps: preprocessing data, training, and evaluation
- Select "Copy & Edit" to reimplement my code

- After that, "Run All" to run all scripts in my notebook

- To evaluate the model with your dataset, in the table of contents, there are:
  - "Test saved model on an image": this part will predict for only one image
  - "Test saved model on your testing dataset": this part is used for evaluation with the full dataset

## Option 2: Google Colab
- Download the notebook: https://github.com/npk7264/Dog-Vs-Cat-Classification/blob/main/evaluate_on_your_dataset.ipynb.
- This notebook is only used for the evaluation of your dataset because I train the model on Kaggle.
- Upload it to Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
- In "Test on an image" part, replace "your_img_path" to predict your image

- In "Evaluate on your dataset", set up you dataset with structure:
