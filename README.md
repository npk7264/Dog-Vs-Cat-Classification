# Dog vs Cat Classification

This is the instruction for my implementation. You can run my code through 2 options: Kaggle or Colab.

## Option 1: Kaggle
- Access to my Kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/npk7264/dog-vs-cat-classification. This notebook contains all the steps: preprocessing data, training, and evaluation
- Select "Copy & Edit" to reimplement my code

- After that, "Run All" to run all scripts in my notebook

- To evaluate the model with your dataset, in the table of contents, there are:
  - "Test saved model on an image": this part will predict for only one image
  - "Test saved model on your testing dataset": this part is used for evaluation with the full dataset
